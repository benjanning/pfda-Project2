# Project 2 for the Programming for Data Analysis Module

## Introduction:

In this project I will be exploring the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. 

The exploration will include:

1) Undertaking an analysis/review of the dataset and presenting an overview and background.
2) Providing a literature review on classifiers which have been applied to the Dataset and comparing their performance.
3) Presenting a statistical analysis of the dataset.
4) Using a range of machine learning algorithms, training a set of classifiers on the dataset and presenting classification performance results.
5) Comparing, contrasting and critiquing results with reference to the literature.
6) Discussing and investigating how the dataset could be extended â€“ using data synthesis of new tumour datapoints.

## Running the Project:

Written in the programming language Python and presented in a Jupyter Notebook, this file can be viewed and edited on a local machine using a Python interpreter, such as VS Code.  Alternaitively it can be run with Jupyter Notebook.
